# Dice Game

- This implementation of the classic Dice Game was part of my learning path provided by **Jonas Schmedtmann** in "The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert".

- While JavaScript follows the learning curve outlined in the course, the styling reflects my personal exploration and experimentation with UI design.

## How to play

- The goal of the game is to be the first player to accumulate a total score of 100 or more points. On each turn, a player continuously rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or they choose to "hold," ending their turn. If a 1 is rolled, the player loses all points accumulated during that turn. If they choose to hold, the points earned during that turn are added to their total score, and the turn ends.

## Technologies Used
